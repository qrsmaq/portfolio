  about: `Welcome to my web development portfolio! I'm a software developer with a love for both the digital world and the great outdoors. When I'm not busy bringing beautiful and functional websites to life, you can find me hiking in the mountains or tending to my vegetable garden. I believe that a balance between work and play is important, and this is reflected in the quality of my work. With a strong foundation in programming and design, I have the skills and experience to bring your project to life. Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio and I hope to work with you soon.`,
